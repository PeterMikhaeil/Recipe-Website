    <h1>Holiday recipes for Witches and Mages</h1>
    <p>
      Its that time of the year for festive music, decorations, and of course,
      food. But where on earth can you find recipes for the palate of us witches
      and mages? Sure we have halloween, but that doesn't mean we should get
      excluded from Christmas! That's why I've compiled some holiday recipes
      using some common shelf ingredients, such as owl's eye, bat drool, and
      frog tears. Have fun spellcasting, and a happy holidays to all :).
